                You are responsible for return shipping fees. All merchandise must be unworn and in the same condition as it was received. Products must be returned in the original box or packaging. We are not able to offer an exchange for items purchased. If you would like a different size or color of an item, then you'll need to place a new order.
            </li>
            <li>
                It may take up to 21 working days (excluding weekends and public holidays) for your return to be delivered back to us, depending on your location and which postal service you use. Once we receive your return parcel, it will be processed within 3 business days (excluding weekends and public holidays.) We will email you to confirm the refund. The funds will be returned via your original payment method. It typically takes 5-10 working days (excluding weekends and public holidays) depending on your bank/card issuer.
